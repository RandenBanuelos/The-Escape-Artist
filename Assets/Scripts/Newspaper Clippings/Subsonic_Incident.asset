  Headline: Thirteen injured in Futuropolis coaster derailment
  Date: Friday, October 15, 1982
  Content: 'Wayne County police have reported that thirteen people, including four
    children, were injured when a roller coaster train derailed at local amusement
    park Futuropolis, formerly known as Camelot Land. Exact specifications have yet
    to be released, but eyewitness testimonies stated that the train seemed to slip
    off the tubular steel track, causing several carts to fall two stories onto the
    sidewalk below. Broken pieces of the front cart''s undercarriage were found around
    the derailment site, on-site reporters added.


    This major accident comes
    almost one year after an employee of Futuropolis'' ride manufacturer, Plausitron
    Engineering''s Jamison E. Phillips, was acquitted of negligence charges after
    a subordinate engineer was killed in a pendulum ride malfunction. Phillips was
    also the lead engineer for Subsonic, the roller coaster the derailment occurred
    on. Phillips declined to make a statement for the Rooster without the presence
    of an attorney.
