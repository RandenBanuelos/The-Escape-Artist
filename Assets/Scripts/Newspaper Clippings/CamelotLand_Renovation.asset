  Headline: Camelot Land announces sci-fi renovation
  Date: Thursday, December 4, 1980
  Content: James Anderson, CEO of local medieval-themed amusement park Camelot Land,
    announced Wednesday that the park would be undergoing a major thematic renovation
    over the next year. In the wake of several science fiction blockbusters grabbing
    the attention of Americans, the decades-old park will be reinventing itself as
    a futuristic utopia, inspired by pulp science fiction novels and atomic age art.
    Longtime contractor Plausitron Engineering will be constructing new rides for
    Camelot Land with the latest advancements in ride technology, spearheaded by
    lead engineer Jamison E. Phillips. "This is an incredibly exciting time," said
    Phillips, "I can't wait for people to see what we're making this time next year."
