  Headline: Engineer killed by theme park ride
  Date: Monday, April 27, 1981
  Content: "The Wayne County Police Department has reported that Wooster resident
    and mechanical engineer Tony Vasquez was struck and killed by a theme park ride
    Friday evening. Vasquez had been oiling one of the joints on a UFO-themed pendulum
    ride for local amusement park Camelot Land when the ride unexpectedly activated.
    Vasquez was knocked off his step ladder by the pendulum, colliding with a nearby
    wall before falling several feet onto the concrete warehouse floor. He was quickly
    rushed to the hospital, but ultimately succumbed to several broken ribs, a fractured
    skull, and severe internal bleeding at 2:05 AM Saturday morning.\r\n\nThe ride's
    head engineer and supervisor, Jamison Phillips, was not at the site when the
    malfunction occurred. According to the WCPD report, Phillips said he had been
    asleep in his vehicle by Camelot Land several miles away when Vasquez was hit,
    only arriving at the scene as Vasquez was being loaded into the ambulance. Phillips
    was taken into police custody shortly after for further interrogation, as he
    and Vasquez had supposedly gotten into a heated argument prior to the incident,
    as reported by several coworkers.\r"
