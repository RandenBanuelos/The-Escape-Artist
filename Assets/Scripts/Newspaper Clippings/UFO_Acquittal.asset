  Headline: Phillips acquitted on UFO negligence charges
  Date: Friday, November 20, 1981
  Content: 'After a months-long court battle, Plausitron engineer Jamison Phillips
    has been found not guilty for the death of junior engineer Tony Vasquez. Vasquez
    was severely injured after a UFO-themed ride of Phillips'' design and supervision
    malfunctioned back in April, passing away shortly thereafter under medical care.
    Coworkers took the stand to explain that Phillips and Vasquez had gotten into
    an agitated disagreement two days prior to the UFO incident, with Phillips storming
    out of the room and refusing to speak with Vasquez in the following days. These
    arguments were not rare between the two, but this fight, in particular, seemed
    particularly heated, said electrical engineer Marie Sousa. "We all knew Jamie
    was working himself to death," said Sousa, "but that was no reason to lash out
    at Tony like that".


    Phillips'' defense attorney, Brian Hampton, argued
    that although Phillips was in the wrong for being aggressive with his coworker,
    he had no ill will towards Vasquez, stating that prolonged sleep deprivation
    made him irritated. Phillips'' alibi stated that he was at local amusement park
    Camelot Land collecting revised failsafe blueprints and batteries when he fell
    asleep in his vehicle, only waking up after a frantic call alerted him to Vasquez''s
    injury. These two factors led the jury to conclude that Vasquez''s death was
    an unfortunate accident. "The jury should be ashamed of themselves," said Vasquez''s
    mother, Guadalupe, "my son is dead and they let that monster escape just because
    he needed a nap, this isn''t the end".
