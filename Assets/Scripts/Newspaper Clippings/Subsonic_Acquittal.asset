  Headline: Phillips acquitted from roller coaster injuries
  Date: Tuesday, February 1, 1983
  Content: The Wayne County Superior Court has ruled that Jamison Phillips, a Wooster
    local and senior engineer for Plausitron Engineering, has been found not guilty
    in relation to a roller coaster derailment at Futuropolis amusement park. Phillips
    was sued by Madisonburg resident June Hendricks for injuries sustained by her
    husband and three teenage children, who were on the Subsonic roller coaster when
    their coaster train slipped off the track and crashed. Phillips' defense attorney
    argued that Phillips, head designer for Subsonic, had vehemently opposed the
    early opening of the ride, stating that several flaws in the train cart's undercarriage
    needed to be addressed before safe operation could ensue. Dated blueprints of
    the improved undercarriage design by Phillips corroborated this statement, coupled
    with the fact that the ride was operating on wet tracks from rain the night before,
    which Phillips detailed would be a safety hazard in his operations manual. Albert
    Weckes, a senior administrator from Futuropolis, took the stand earlier last
    week to refute this argument, saying that Plausitron's outreach team assured
    him the ride would have all failsafes implemented ahead of schedule.
